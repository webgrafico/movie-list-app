# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

## Why vite

I selected vite to have faster bundling times and updates.
More info and details can be checked in
[this VITE docs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html).

## Environment Variables

I create a `.env` file which can have
inside the value:

```
VITE_API_KEY=
```

This value are mainly used to pass API KEY to requests from API in v3.

## Available Scripts

Install

### `yarn install`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
